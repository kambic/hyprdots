===========================================================================
*04_1*	The .vimrc file

You probably got tired of typing commands that you use very often.  To start
with all your favorite option settings and mappings, you write them in what
is called the vimrc file.

For Unix this file is always used: >

	~/.vimrc

The vimrc file can contain all the commands that you type after a colon.
The most simple ones are for setting options.  For example, if you want Vim
to always start with the 'incsearch' option on, add this line you your vimrc
file: >

	set is

You can always use the full option name instead for verbosity. Here instead
you can write >

	set incsearch

The colon at the start can be omitted while writing your .vimrc file.

===========================================================================
*04_2*	Vim settings

There are basically two type of settings in vim. Some options can be set
either on or off. These are called as boolean setting. These options can be
switched on using syntax >

	:set {option}

and switched off using >

	:set no{option}

The option 'incsearch' is an example of boolean setting.

The other type of options take argument. The type of arguments varies from
setting to setting. The format for setting these options is >

	:set {option}={values}

An example of this type is the option 'nrformats'. >

	:set nrformats=octal,hex


Finding the value of an option ~

If you want to find the current value of an option, use the command >

	:set {option}?

The value of the option will be displayed in a format which is specifiable
after a set command.


Oops! I messed up an option ~

You can reset an option to its default value by typing >

	:set {option}&

===========================================================================
*04_3*	Basic settings

Do you want your vim to behave in a 'vi' compatible way? This can be set
using the option 'compatible'. It is always advisable to set this option
off, else you wont be able to use many of the powerful vim features. This
includes manu of the commands in this tutorial. >

	:se nocp

What are the number of columns after which you want the text to wrap while
editing. This can be set using either the 'textwidth' or 'wrapmargin'
option. If a line is longer than the text width, it is broken at a
whitespace to get the desired textwidth. If this option is set to 0,
wrapmargin is looked at. This option indicates the number of characters from
the right window border where wrapping starts. >

	:set tw 76

This sets the text width to 76. >

	:set wm=4

This sets the text to wrap if the line get longer than window width - 4.


===========================================================================
*04_4*	Look and feel settings

By default the status bar is present for the last window (The windows
adjacent to the command line) only if more than one window is open. To
control the behaviour you can use 'laststatus' option. >

	:set ls=2	(always present)
	:set ls=1	(default, only if more than two windows)
	:set ls=0	(never present)

Note: Windows other than last window, always have status bars.

You always want the statistics of the file to be displayed. You can use >

	:set ru

You want the mode in which you are to be shown (for modes other than
normal), use the setting 'showmode' >

	:set smd

===========================================================================
*04_5*	Editing settings

Should the new line carry the indentation of the last line or should it
start from the first column. This former can be done by switching on the
option 'autoindent'. >

	:set ai

Do you want your searches and completions to be case-insensitive? You can
set the option 'ignorecase' (This is not recommended for c/c++ code) >

	:set ic
