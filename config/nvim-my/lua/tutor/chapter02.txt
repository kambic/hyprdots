|02_3|	Moving to a character
|02_4|	Matching parenthesis
|02_5|	Moving to a specific line
|02_6|	Telling where you are
|02_7|	Scrolling around
|02_8|	Readjusting the view without moving cursor
|02_9|	Moving cursor without changing the view

===========================================================================
*02_1*	Moving word-wise

To move the cursor forward one word, use the "w" command.  Like most Vim
commands, you can use a numeric prefix to move past multiple words.  For
example, "3w" moves three words.  This figure shows how it works:

	This is a line with example text ~
	  --->-->->----------------->
	   w  w  w    3w

Notice that "w" moves to the start of the next word if it already is at the
start of a word.

The "b" command moves backward to the start of the previous word:

	This is a line with example text ~
	<----<--<-<---------<---
	   b   b b    2b      b

There is also the "e" command that moves to the next end of a word and "ge",
which moves to the previous end of a word:

	This is a line with example text ~
	   <-   <--- ----->   ---->
	   ge    ge     e       e

If you are at the last word of a line, the "w" command will take you to the
first word in the next line.  Thus you can use this to move through a
paragraph, much faster than using "l".  "b" does the same in the other
direction.

In all the above cases, the words are seperated by whitespace or punctuation
marks. If you just want to consider words as seperated by whitespace, the
following commands can be used: >

	W
	B
	E
	gE
<

===========================================================================
*02_2*	Moving to start or end of a line

The "$" command moves the cursor to the end of a line.  If your keyboard has
an <End> key it will do the same thing.

The "^" command moves to the first nonblank character of the line.  The "0"
command (zero) moves to the very first character of the line.  The <Home>
key does the same thing.  In a picture:

		  ^
	     <------------
	.....This is a line with example text ~
	<-----------------   --------------->
		0		   $

(the "....." indicates blanks here)

The "$" command takes a count, like most movement commands.  But moving to
the end of the line several times doesn't make sense.  Therefore it causes
the editor to move to the end of another line.  For example, "1$" moves you
to the end of the first line (the one you're on), "2$" to the end of the
next line, and so on.  The "0" command doesn't take a count argument,
because the "0" would be part of the count.  Unexpectedly, using a count
with "^" doesn't have any effect.


===========================================================================
*02_3*	Moving to a character

One of the most useful movement commands is the single-character search
command.  The command "fx" searches forward in the line for the single
character x.

For example, you are at the beginning of the following line.  Suppose you
want to go to the h of human.  Just execute the command "fh" and the cursor
will be positioned over the h:

	To err is human.  To really foul up you need a computer. ~
	---------->--------------->
	    fh		 fy

This also shows that the command "fy" moves to the end of the word really.
You can specify a count; therefore, you can go to the "l" of "foul" with
"3fl":

	To err is human.  To really foul up you need a computer. ~
		  --------------------->
			   3fl

The "F" command searches to the left:

	To err is human.  To really foul up you need a computer. ~
		  <---------------------
			    Fh

The "tx" command works like the "fx" command, except it stops one character
before the searched character.  Hint: "t" stands for "To".  The backward
version of this command is "Tx".

	To err is human.  To really foul up you need a computer. ~
		   <------------  ------------->
			Th		tn

These four commands can be repeated with ";".  "," repeats in the other
direction.  The cursor is never moved to another line.  Not even when the
sentence continues.

===========================================================================
*02_4*	Matching parenthesis

When writing a program you often end up with nested () constructs.  Then the
"%" command is very handy: It moves to the matching paren.  If the cursor is
on a "(" it will move to the matching ")".  If it's on a ")" it will move to
the matching "(".

			    %
			 <----->
		if (a == (b * c) / d) ~
		   <---------------->
			    %

This also works for [] and {} pairs.

When the cursor is not on a useful character, "%" will search forward to
find one.  Thus if the cursor is at the start of the line of the previous
example, "%" will search forward and find the first "(".  Then it moves to
its match:

		if (a == (b * c) / d) ~
		---+---------------->
			   %


===========================================================================
*02_5*	Moving to a specific line

If you are a C or C++ programmer, you are familiar with error messages such
as the following:

	prog.c:33: j   undeclared (first use in this function) ~

You can directly jump to the given line using the "G" command. With a count,
this command positions you at the given line number.  For example, "33G"
puts you on line 33.  With no argument, "G" positions you at the end of the
file.  A quick way to go to the start of a file use "gg".  "1G" will do the
same, but is a tiny bit more typing.

	    |	first line of a file   ^     ~
	    |	text text text text    |     ~
	    |	text text text text    |  gg ~
	7G  |	text text text text    |     ~
	    |	text text text text          ~
	    |	text text text text          ~
	    V	text text text text    |     ~
		text text text text    |  G  ~
		text text text text    |     ~
		last line of a file    V     ~

NOTE: Many user would be accustomed to the ":33" format of command also.

Another way to move to a line is using the "%" command with a count.  For
example >

	50%	(moves you to halfway the file)
	90%	(goes to near the end)


===========================================================================
*02_6*	Telling where you are

To see where you are in a file, there are three ways:

1.  Use the CTRL-G command.  You get a message like this (assuming the
    'ruler' option is off):

	"usr_03.txt" line 233 of 650 --35%-- col 45-52~

    Sometimes you will see a split column number.  For example, "col 2-9".
    This indicates that the cursor is positioned on the second character,
    but because character one is a tab, occupying eight spaces worth of
    columns, the screen column is 9.

2.  Set the 'number' option.  This will display a line number in front of
    every line: >

	:set number
<
    To switch this off again: >

	:set nonumber
<
3.  Set the 'ruler' option.  This will display the cursor position in the
    lower right corner of the Vim window: >

	:set ruler
<
    Using the 'ruler' option has the advantage that it doesn't take much
    room, thus there is more space for your text.


===========================================================================
*02_7*	Scrolling around

The CTRL-U command scrolls down half a screen of text.  Think of looking
through a viewing window at the text and moving this window up by half the
height of the window.  Thus the window moves up over the text, which is
backward in the file.

The CTRL-D command moves the viewing window down half a screen in the file,
thus scrolls the text up half a screen.

				       +----------------+ ~
				       | some text	| ~
				       | some text	| ~
				       | some text	| ~
	+---------------+	       | some text	| ~
	| some text	|  CTRL-U  --> |		| ~
	|		|	       | 123456		| ~
	| 123456	|	       +----------------+ ~
	| 7890		| ~
	|		|	       +----------------+ ~
	| example	|  CTRL-D -->  | 7890		| ~
	+---------------+	       |		| ~
				       | example	| ~
				       | example	| ~
				       | example	| ~
				       | example	| ~
				       +----------------+ ~

To scroll forward by a whole screen (except for two lines) use CTRL-F.  The
other way is backward, CTRL-B is the command to use.  Fortunately CTRL-F is
Forward and CTRL-B is Backward, that's easy to remember.

===========================================================================
*02_8*	Readjusting the view without moving cursor

A common issue is that after moving around many lines using the previous
command is that the lines you want to see are either at the bottom or at the
top of the screen. In such occasions, you just want to change the view
without moving the cursor. The following commands give you such an option.

To scroll one line at a time use CTRL-E (scroll up) and CTRL-Y (scroll
down).

You may want the center the line on which the cursor is present. This is
done with the "zz" command.

	+------------------+		 +------------------+ ~
	| some text	   |		 | some text	    | ~
	| some text	   |		 | some text	    | ~
	| some text	   |		 | some text	    | ~
	| some text	   |   zz  -->	 | line with cursor | ~
	| some text	   |		 | some text	    | ~
	| some text	   |		 | some text	    | ~
	| line with cursor |		 | some text	    | ~
	+------------------+		 +------------------+ ~

The "zt" command puts the cursor line at the top, "zb" at the bottom.


===========================================================================
*02_9*	Moving cursor without changing the view

There are occasions where you want to move around in the area which is
visible to you. You also dont want to change the view. This figure shows
the three commands you can use:

			+---------------------------+ ~
		H -->	| text sample text	    | ~
			| sample text		    | ~
			| text sample text	    | ~
			| sample text		    | ~
		M -->	| text sample text	    | ~
			| sample text		    | ~
			| text sample text	    | ~
			| sample text		    | ~
		L -->	| text sample text	    | ~
			+---------------------------+ ~

Hints: "H" stands for Home, "M" for Middle and "L" for Last.
