*14*	How to use online-help

This chapter gives some details about the usage of vim online-help

|14_1|	Two manuals
|14_2|	Finding the subject
|14_3|	Finding about a command

===========================================================================
*14_1*	Two manuals

The Vim documentation consists of two parts:

1. The User manual
   Task oriented explanations, from simple to complex.  Reads from start to
   end like a book.

2. The Reference manual
   Precise description of how everything in Vim works.

Jumping around ~

The text contains hyperlinks between the two parts, allowing you to quickly
jump between the description of an editing task and a precise explanation of
the commands and options used for it.  Use these two commands:

	Press  CTRL-]  to jump to a subject under the cursor.
	Press  CTRL-O  to jump back (repeat to go further back).

Many links are in vertical bars, like this: |14_1|.  An option name, like
'number', a command in double quotes like ":write" and any other word can
also be used as a link.

Other subjects can be found with the ":help" command. >

	:help <subject>

===========================================================================
*14_2*	Finding the subject

You want to find about text objects, but dont exactly know what name they
would be listed under. You can take a guess. Probably the topic name would
contain the name "object". So try >

	:help object<TAB>

You actually type a tab after "object". This would start listing the
possible matches cyclically. The possible completions would be displayed on
the command line itself. When you think that you have found what you want,
press Enter. In this case, you would find that the fourth match is
text-objects.

===========================================================================
*14_3*	Finding about a command

You can find about various commands by typing >

	:help <command>

By default the command is assumed to be a normal mode command. If it is an
insert/replace mode command, try >

	:help i_<command>

Similarly, type the following for command line commands >

	:help :<command>

So go out on your explorations and happy vimming!
