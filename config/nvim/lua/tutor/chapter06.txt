*06_1*	Introduction

In Insert and Replace modes, there are several commands to complete part of
a keyword or line that has been typed.  This is useful if you are using
complicated keywords. (e.g., function names with capitals and underscores).
These commands together are termed as auto-completions.


===========================================================================
*06_2*	Word completions

You are typing a report and have taken pains to find out the spelling of the
word 'antidisestablishmentarianism'.  You have to use it again. What will
you do?  Go back to the place where you have typed it first, see the
spelling it again? No! Go there copy it and paste it where you need it
again?  Probably, yes. But there is a still easier way to do it :). Just
enter >

	anti<CTRL-P>

This would complete the word with the previous word which started with
"anti". If this is not the word you are looking for, enter <CTRL-P> again.
Keep doing it and you get your word! You did not even have to exit the
Insert/Replace mode you were in.

Similarly, you have gone ahead with your editing and now you have to replace
a word you have typed earlier with a new word, you can try >

	<CTRL-N>

Both these commands would come back to what you have actually typed when all
the matches have exhausted.


===========================================================================
*06_3*	Line completions

Similar to word completions, you can complete lines also. This requires two
keystrokes instead of one, but you can do it. Enter the start of the line
and then enter >

	<CTRL-X><CTRL-L>

This would list the previous match for the line, if any.  Now, you can
navigate through the lines using <CTRL-P> and <CTRL-N>.


===========================================================================
*06_4*	Dictionary/Thesaurus completions

You can do spell checks on the fly by having vim complete spellings by
looking at the dictionary. You can do this by typing the initial part of the
word and then typing >

	<CTRL-X><CTRL-K>

You can always navigate using <CTRL-P> and <CTRL-N>. You could have got the
word we saw earlier by typing >

	antidis<CTRL-X><CTRL-K>

To be able to use a dictionary, you should set option 'dictionary' to your
dictionary file >

	:set dictionary=/usr/dict/words,/usr/share/dict/words

You can also find synonyms for a word by using the thesaurus completion
command >

	<CTRL-X><CTRL-T>

You need to set the 'thesaurus' option to use this command >

	:set thesaurus=<filename>

*06_5*	Other searches

Completing keywords from included files ~

There are other searches that can be performed. For example, you can search
for a keyword through included files also >

	<CTRL-X><CTRL-I>

The option 'path' can be used to set the directories where your include
files are searched for. If you just want #define macros, you can use >

	<CTRL-X><CTRL-D>


Completing filenames ~

This can be done using the command >

	<CTRL-X><CTRL-F>


Completing tags ~

This can be done using the command >

	<CTRL-X><CTRL-]>
