*11_1*	What is QuickFix?

Vim has a special mode to speedup the edit-compile-edit cycle.  The idea is
to save the error messages from the compiler in a file and use Vim to jump
to the errors one by one.  You can then examine each problem and fix it,
without having to remember all the error messages.

You can compile your program from within vim, by issuing the following
command >

	:make [arguments]

Vim has a variable 'makeprg' which is invoked when this command is called.
By default 'makeprg' is set to "make". But if you want to compile a single
file, set >

	:set makeprg=gcc\ -c

And then compile the current file using the command >

	:make %

You can also use the following command to use the quickfix mode >

	:grep

The variable which controls this command is 'grepprg'. By default its value
is set to "grep\ -n".

*11_2*	Error navigation

You can see the list of errors encountered in your last compilation or grep
invocation by issuing the command >

	:cl[ist]

All the commands for file navigation prefixed by the character 'c' are used
for error navigation in this case. For example, to go to the next error, you
can use >

	:cn[ext]

This would open the file and jump to the line in which the error is. You can
fix the error and jump to the next error to fix it.

Following are the other commands that you can use in the error navigation >

	:cp[revious]	(Previous error)
	:cN[ext]	(same as cprevious)
	:cr[ewind]	(Go to first error)
	:cfir[st]	(Same as cfirst)
	:cla[st]	(Go to last error)
