*01_1*	The first steps in Vim


Open a file to edit: ~

You can invoke vim with the following command >

	bash> vim file.txt

This opens the vim editor in your terminal itself >

	bash> gvim file.txt

This open the GUI version of vim.


Edit the opened file: ~

You can start entering text by pressing >

	i

What ever you type after it is entered into the file. To delete what ever
you have entered, you can use backspace. When you have done entering the
text, type >

	<ESC>


Save your changes and quit: ~

You can save the changes you have made, by typing >

	:w[rite]

You can quit vim by typing >

	:q[uit]

If any changes were made, you need to save them. Else, you just need to
exit. There are commands which do these decision making >

	:x
	:exi[t]
	ZZ
<
It is generally better to use :x to quit, rather than :q or :wq. The latter
changes the time stamp of the file, even if no changes are made.
