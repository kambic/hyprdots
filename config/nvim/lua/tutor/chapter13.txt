*13_1*	What are text objects?

This is a series of commands that can only be used while in Visual mode or
after an operator.  The commands that start with "a" select "a"n object
including white space, the commands starting with "i" select an "inner"
object without white space, or just the white space.  Thus the "inner"
commands always select less text than the "a" commands.

*13_2*	How to use text objects?

If the cursor is in the middle of a word and want to delete that word, you
need to move back to its start before you can do "dw".  There is a simpler
way to do this: "daw".

	this is some example text. ~
		       daw

	this is some text. ~

The "d" of "daw" is the delete operator.  "aw" is a text object.  Hint: "aw"
stands for "A Word".  Thus "daw" is "Delete A Word".

Using text objects is the third way to make changes in Vim.  We already had
operator-motion and Visual mode.  Now we add operator-text object.

It is very similar to operator-motion, but instead of operating on the text
between the cursor position before and after a movement command, the text
object is used as a whole.  It doesn't matter where in the object the cursor
was.

To change a whole sentence use "cis".  Take this text:

	Hello there.  This ~
	is an example.  Just ~
	some text. ~

Move to the start of the second line, on "is an".  Now use "cis":

	Hello there.    Just ~
	some text. ~

The cursor is in between the blanks in the first line.  Now you type the new
sentence "Another line.":

	Hello there.  Another line.  Just ~
	some text. ~

"cis" consists of the "c" (change) operator and the "is" text object.  This
stands for "Inner Sentence".  There is also the "as" (a sentence) object.
The difference is that "as" includes the white space after the sentence and
"is" doesn't.  If you would delete a sentence, you want to delete the white
space at the same time, thus use "das".  If you want to type new text the
white space can remain, thus you use "cis".

You can also use text objects in Visual mode.  It will include the text
object in the Visual selection.  Visual mode continues, thus you can do this
several times.  For example, start Visual mode with "v" and select a
sentence with "as".  Now you can repeat "as" to include more sentences.
Finally you use an operator to do something with the selected sentences.

*13_3*	List of text objects

The following is a table of text-object which can be used for editing. These
object name can be used after an 'a' or an 'i'. For example 'w' gives "aw"
or "iw".

w		word
W		white-space separated WORD
s		sentence
p		paragraph"
[ or ]		[] block
( or ) or b	() block
< or >		<> block
{ or } or B	{} block

These object can be used with various operator commands to quicken your
editing. One very useful command based on text objects is >

	gqap

Here "gq" is the justify operator and it is applied on "a paragraph".  This
command justifies a paragraph according to your vim settings.
