Got it! You want a **dual-GPU setup** on an HP Z4 G4 (Xeon) workstation, with an **AMD RX 6600 for gaming** and an **NVIDIA card purely for CUDA / compute tasks**. Let’s plan this carefully for **maximum performance and minimal conflicts**.

---

## 1️⃣ Key Principles for Mixed GPU Setups

1. **Slot bandwidth priority**:

   * GPU that does gaming (RX 6600) → Slot 1 (PCIe 3.0 x16 CPU).
   * GPU used for compute (NVIDIA / CUDA) → Slot 3 (x16 mechanical / x8 electrical CPU).
   * Lower-bandwidth expansion cards → PCH x4 slots.

2. **Driver coexistence**:

   * AMD for gaming → Radeon Software.
   * NVIDIA for CUDA → Install NVIDIA driver only for compute tasks (don’t install GeForce Experience if you want a “headless” compute card).
   * Both AMD and NVIDIA can coexist on Windows 10/11 without major issues, but avoid trying to run both in SLI / Crossfire (they can’t cross GPU vendors).

3. **Cooling & power**:

   * Make sure your PSU has enough wattage for both cards.
   * The Z4 G4 supports dual-slot GPUs, so check spacing for airflow.
   * Don’t put both high-power GPUs too close to block each other’s cooling.

## 2️⃣ Recommended Slot Layout (HP Z4 G4)

| Slot   | GPU / Device          | Lane Source                        | Notes                               |
| ------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Slot 1 | AMD RX 6600           | CPU x16                            | Primary gaming GPU                  |
| Slot 3 | NVIDIA (compute-only) | CPU x16 mechanical / x8 electrical | Headless CUDA tasks                 |
| Slot 2 | Optional card         | PCH x4                             | NIC, sound, low-bandwidth expansion |
| Slot 4 | Optional card         | PCH x4                             | NIC, sound, low-bandwidth expansion |
| Slot 5 | Optional card         | Mechanical x8 / low-priority       | Only if needed                      |

**M.2 NVMe drives** → Use the two M.2 slots on the motherboard; they are CPU x4 each and usually won’t interfere with GPU lanes unless you populate both + many PCIe cards.

## 3️⃣ Optimization Tips

1. **Gaming GPU (RX 6600) in Slot 1**:

   * Full x16 lanes for minimal bottleneck.
   * Driver: Radeon Software.

2. **CUDA GPU**:

   * Can be headless (no monitor).
   * Full NVIDIA driver, preferably “Studio / Compute” drivers.
   * Keep in Slot 3 if possible to give maximum CPU-connected lanes.

3. **Avoid sharing lanes**:

   * Don’t put another high-bandwidth card (capture cards, PCIe SSD) in Slot 3 if you want full GPU performance on CUDA card.

4. **BIOS settings**:

   * Ensure PCIe slots are set to **Gen3 x16 / x8 auto**.
   * Disable unnecessary features that could reserve lanes (Thunderbolt if not used).

5. **Cooling**:

   * Two dual-slot GPUs → install with at least one empty slot between them if possible.
   * Consider auxiliary fans for the rear / top of the chassis.

### ✅ Summary

* **Primary gaming**: AMD RX 6600 → Slot 1 (x16 CPU).
* **CUDA compute**: NVIDIA card → Slot 3 (x16 mech / x8 electrical CPU).
* **Optional low-bandwidth devices** → PCH x4 slots.
* **Keep PSU and cooling in mind**.
* Drivers can coexist on Windows; install Radeon first, then NVIDIA for compute.

If you want, I can **draw an annotated Z4 G4 slot diagram** showing exactly where the RX 6600 and NVIDIA CUDA card should go for the best balance of gaming and compute performance. This makes it visually clear which slots to use and which to avoid.

Do you want me to do that?

Here are annotated diagrams of the HP Z4 G4 showing PCIe‑slot layout so you can visualise where to place your GPUs (gaming: AMD RX 6600 + CUDA compute: NVIDIA).

### ✅ Recommended placement summary

* Use **Slot 1** (x16 from CPU) for your **AMD RX 6600** (gaming).
* Use **Slot 3** (mechanical x16, electrical x8 from CPU) for your **NVIDIA CUDA GPU** (compute‑only).
* Use the smaller x4 slots (Slot 2, Slot 4) for lower‑bandwidth cards (network, capture, etc) so they don’t steal lanes from the main GPU slots.
* Make sure there’s adequate cooling and spacing between the two GPUs.
* In BIOS, ensure each slot is enabled and set to Gen3 x16/x8 as appropriate.

### Highlights from the diagram & specs

* The Z4 G4 supports **five high‑performance graphics/expansion slots** plus a mechanical bulkhead slot. ([Workstation4U][1])
* Slot details (from manual):

  * Slot 1 → PCIe Gen3 x16 from CPU. ([Search Manual][2])
  * Slot 2 → PCIe Gen3 x4 from PCH (chipset). ([Search Manual][2])
  * Slot 3 → PCIe Gen3 x16 mechanical / x8 electrical from CPU. ([Manuals+][3])
  * Slot 4 → PCIe Gen3 x4 from PCH. ([Search Manual][2])
  * Slot 5 → PCIe Gen3 x8 (mechanical only) with open connector. ([Manuals+][4])
* M.2 NVMe slots: two CPU‑connected PCIe Gen3 x4 slots for SSDs. ([Manuals+][3])

### Recommended mapping for your dual‑GPU + expansion setup

* Place your gaming GPU (e.g., AMD RX 6600) in **Slot 1** for full x16 CPU lanes.
* Place your CUDA compute GPU (NVIDIA) in **Slot 3**, which gives good CPU‑connected lanes (x16 mechanical / x8 electrical) — still strong.
* Use Slot 2 & Slot 4 for lower‑bandwidth cards (e.g., networking, capture, NVMe adapter) so you don’t steal lanes from the main GPUs.
* Slot 5 can be used if needed but is lower priority due to lane layout and electrical constraints.
* Ensure M.2 drives go into their dedicated sockets since they’re CPU‑connected and won’t block GPU slots.
